		<h3>How I came up with this username</h3>
		<p>Back when I was a kid in 2012 there was a Mr. Young episode (I don't remember which) where Derby threw a fake stick through a window and said "Uhhh... Clank!" after it landed.
		<br>Then in July when I was signing up for a website I suddenly remembered the episode and chose "clanc" as my username.</p>
		
		<h3>How I got into Touhou</h3>
		<p>Back in 2011 to 2012 I became obsessed with Synthesia videos. Eventually I came across the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tds0qoxWVss">Death Waltz</a> video (which is actually a black MIDI of Last Brutal Sister Flandre S.) and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_asG0vmsec">Necrofantasia</a> MIDI. I thought they sounded cool but didn't really care about where did they come from.
		<br>Over time, in 2013, I learned that Death Waltz was actually a remix of a song called "U.N. Owen was Her?" from Touhou 6. I also saw black MIDIs of Night of Nights and Bad Apple, both also from the same series. I learned that Touhou was actually game series by ZUN, so I got EoSD, downloaded a spanish patch and tried it out.
		<br>Now you have me here obsessing over fictional women lol.
		<br>
		<br>By the way I only found out several years later that Last Brutal Sister Flandre S. was also based on NO REMORSE from Ketsui and Hibachi from Daioujou.</p>
